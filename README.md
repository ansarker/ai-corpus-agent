# Multi-Agent RAG Pipeline

This repository implements a modular, multi-agent architecture for document ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and reasoning.

It is built around LangChain and Ollama model, and allows multi-turn, query-driven orchestration with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), summarization, and classification capabilities.

### Features

* **IngestionAgent** â†’ Loads raw documents (e.g. PDFs).
* **EmbeddingAgent** â†’ Embeds and stores documents in a vector DB (db_store/).
* **RetrieverAgent** â†’ Fetches top-k relevant documents for a query.
* **ResponseAgent (RAG)** â†’ Generates answers with context from the retriever.
* **SummarizerAgent** â†’ Summarizes retrieved content.
* **ClassifierAgent** â†’ Classifies content into categories.
* **OrchestratorAgent** â†’ Routes queries to the right agent depending on intent.
